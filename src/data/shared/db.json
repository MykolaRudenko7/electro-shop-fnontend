        "text": "Intel took back processor market share from AMD in the final quarter of 2020 not just in terms of mobile CPUs for laptops, but also on the desktop, very much against the grain of recent times, according to a new report.\n\nMercury Research has shared its stats on the PC processor market for Q4 of 2020, during which AMD may have lost overall market share to Intel, but it still made strong gains – thanks to the major growth spurred on by the spike in sales due to the ongoing pandemic (and more folks buying hardware as a result, with working from home becoming a much more common thing).\n\nHere are the best gaming PCs\nWe’ve picked out all the best processors\nAnd check out the best motherboards\nAccording to Mercury Research, the x86 CPU market grew by a massive 20.1% in Q4. AMD, however, dropped to a 19.3% market share on the desktop, down on the previous quarter (where it stood at 20.1%). Even so, AMD was still up year-on-year, compared to its 18.3% tally for the final quarter of 2019.\n\nAnd of course, given the huge traction in the overall market, AMD was still making a lot more money, and as we saw with the company’s own figures, it made a killing in Q4 (with revenue up over 50% compared to the same quarter in 2019, making Q4 2020 the best quarter AMD has ever had, in fact).\n\nSo there’s nothing bad about AMD’s performance here – far from it – but nonetheless it’s a bit of a shock to see Intel gain market share in desktop chips for the first time in three years.",

        "text": "Choosing between the best business computers is no small feat and there are many factors to consider. To give you a helping hand, this guide offers a rundown of the best business desktop PCs money can buy.\n\nLaptops and smartphones are essential business tools, and are becoming more powerful and feature-rich every year, but while they are good for people who travel a lot for work, they cannot compete with the best business computers for certain tasks.\n\nFor a start, desktop PCs are much more powerful than the best business laptops, and they are cheaper as well. Also, unless you're buying an all-in-one computer, these business computers are also relatively easy to open up and upgrade, making them far more future-proof than laptops or smartphones, which can sometimes start to feel rather outdated after only a few years.\n\nThis makes the best business computers a wise financial decision when kitting out your office. And, while traditional desktop PCs are excellent devices to have in an office, we've also listed some of the best all-in-one PCs as well. These devices, like Apple's iconic iMac, have the computing components built into a screen. While this means they are less easily upgradable than traditional PCs, they are easier to set up, take up less space on a desk, and look fantastic as well. Aesthetics might not be your primary concern when buying a business computer, but they will make almost any office or studio look clean and modern.\n\nWe've also included our exclusive price comparison tool, which will search the web for the best deals, so once you’ve found the best business computer for your needs, you can buy in confidence knowing you’re getting the best price.",

        "text": "AMD is making impressive strides when it comes to gaming on Linux, both in terms of adoption of its processors and graphics cards with desktop PCs, according to a new report.\n\nThe AMD versus Intel or Nvidia battles are well-documented in general, of course, but it’s certainly interesting to see a snapshot of the Linux world, as brought to us by Boiling Steam, with stats compiled using data from ProtonDB.\n\nBest free-to-play Steam games\nBest Linux distros for gaming\nWe'll show you how to build a PC\nAs Boiling Steam notes, the Steam hardware report doesn’t provide enough depth to drill-down into PC configurations, but ProtonDB – a site that tracks the compatibility of games with Valve’s Proton (the runtime for playing Steam games on Linux) – is more useful in this respect, if more limited in terms of sample size.\n\nAt any rate, going with a sample of over 110,000 Linux gamers drawn from ProtonDB, when it comes to graphics cards, Nvidia is clearly in the lead – but not nearly as dominant as it is in the broader PC gaming arena.\n\nAs of January 2021, 37.5% of Linux gamers have thrown their lot in with AMD, meaning Nvidia owns a 62.5% market share, Boiling Steam observes. That is, of course, still very much the majority, but compare that to recent figures from analytics firm Jon Peddie Research (JPR) for the overall discrete GPU market, where Nvidia has been seen to own an 80% market share.\n\nWhat’s even more telling here is that if you look at the Boiling Steam stats for January 2019, the picture was similar to JPR with a 25% share for AMD – so that has leapt by a 50% increase over the course of two years. Impressive growth for AMD on Linux, indeed.\n\n",

This is the first time a MacBook has topped our best laptops list, but the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is worthy of this spot. Thanks to the revolutionary ARM-based Apple M1 chip that powers the new MacBook Air (Apple has ditched Intel for these new laptops), this is a stunning achievement: a thin and light laptop that offers great performance, even with 4K video editing, while also offering incredible battery life. Easily managing over 11 hours on a single charge, this is a laptop you can easily carry around with you at work or school, and its price is incredibly competitive compared to Windows 10 rivals like the Dell XPS 15 (below). Running both new and old Mac apps, the new MacBook Air can now also run iOS apps for iPhone and iPads, giving it access to hundreds of brilliant mobile applications and games as well.\\n\\nEven if you've only ever used Windows laptops before, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is well worth getting and making the jump to macOS.

And, so long as you’re not expecting Ultra settings or 4K performance, a gaming PC that doesn’t come with an outrageous price tag should still be just as competent when it comes to the latest AAA games.\n\nYou may not get all the bells and whistles of the most expensive gaming rigs but the best budget gaming PCs are worth a look. A fantastic, immersive gaming experience really doesn’t require a pricey, maxed out desktop. There are plenty of less expensive, yet capable components available such as Intel’s Coffee Lake Refresh, AMD’s Ryzen 3nd Generation, not to mention the AMD Navi GPUs, that allow less expensive PCs the ability to provide that quality gaming experience. \n\nBasically, you’ll be able to fulfill all your gaming desires with the best budget gaming PCs. Whether you don’t care about gaming at the highest settings or are on a limited budget, these machines will do you justice. And, your bank account won’t be hurting either.",

      "text": "Intel took back processor market share from AMD in the final quarter of 2020 not just in terms of mobile CPUs for laptops, but also on the desktop, very much against the grain of recent times, according to a new report.\n\nMercury Research has shared its stats on the PC processor market for Q4 of 2020, during which AMD may have lost overall market share to Intel, but it still made strong gains – thanks to the major growth spurred on by the spike in sales due to the ongoing pandemic (and more folks buying hardware as a result, with working from home becoming a much more common thing).\n\nHere are the best gaming PCs\nWe’ve picked out all the best processors\nAnd check out the best motherboards\nAccording to Mercury Research, the x86 CPU market grew by a massive 20.1% in Q4. AMD, however, dropped to a 19.3% market share on the desktop, down on the previous quarter (where it stood at 20.1%). Even so, AMD was still up year-on-year, compared to its 18.3% tally for the final quarter of 2019.\n\nAnd of course, given the huge traction in the overall market, AMD was still making a lot more money, and as we saw with the company’s own figures, it made a killing in Q4 (with revenue up over 50% compared to the same quarter in 2019, making Q4 2020 the best quarter AMD has ever had, in fact).\n\nSo there’s nothing bad about AMD’s performance here – far from it – but nonetheless it’s a bit of a shock to see Intel gain market share in desktop chips for the first time in three years.",

      "text": "Choosing between the best business computers is no small feat and there are many factors to consider. To give you a helping hand, this guide offers a rundown of the best business desktop PCs money can buy.\n\nLaptops and smartphones are essential business tools, and are becoming more powerful and feature-rich every year, but while they are good for people who travel a lot for work, they cannot compete with the best business computers for certain tasks.\n\nFor a start, desktop PCs are much more powerful than the best business laptops, and they are cheaper as well. Also, unless you're buying an all-in-one computer, these business computers are also relatively easy to open up and upgrade, making them far more future-proof than laptops or smartphones, which can sometimes start to feel rather outdated after only a few years.\n\nThis makes the best business computers a wise financial decision when kitting out your office. And, while traditional desktop PCs are excellent devices to have in an office, we've also listed some of the best all-in-one PCs as well. These devices, like Apple's iconic iMac, have the computing components built into a screen. While this means they are less easily upgradable than traditional PCs, they are easier to set up, take up less space on a desk, and look fantastic as well. Aesthetics might not be your primary concern when buying a business computer, but they will make almost any office or studio look clean and modern.\n\nWe've also included our exclusive price comparison tool, which will search the web for the best deals, so once you’ve found the best business computer for your needs, you can buy in confidence knowing you’re getting the best price.",

      "text": "AMD is making impressive strides when it comes to gaming on Linux, both in terms of adoption of its processors and graphics cards with desktop PCs, according to a new report.\n\nThe AMD versus Intel or Nvidia battles are well-documented in general, of course, but it’s certainly interesting to see a snapshot of the Linux world, as brought to us by Boiling Steam, with stats compiled using data from ProtonDB.\n\nBest free-to-play Steam games\nBest Linux distros for gaming\nWe'll show you how to build a PC\nAs Boiling Steam notes, the Steam hardware report doesn’t provide enough depth to drill-down into PC configurations, but ProtonDB – a site that tracks the compatibility of games with Valve’s Proton (the runtime for playing Steam games on Linux) – is more useful in this respect, if more limited in terms of sample size.\n\nAt any rate, going with a sample of over 110,000 Linux gamers drawn from ProtonDB, when it comes to graphics cards, Nvidia is clearly in the lead – but not nearly as dominant as it is in the broader PC gaming arena.\n\nAs of January 2021, 37.5% of Linux gamers have thrown their lot in with AMD, meaning Nvidia owns a 62.5% market share, Boiling Steam observes. That is, of course, still very much the majority, but compare that to recent figures from analytics firm Jon Peddie Research (JPR) for the overall discrete GPU market, where Nvidia has been seen to own an 80% market share.\n\nWhat’s even more telling here is that if you look at the Boiling Steam stats for January 2019, the picture was similar to JPR with a 25% share for AMD – so that has leapt by a 50% increase over the course of two years. Impressive growth for AMD on Linux, indeed.\n\n",

      "text": "The new Apple MacBook Air (M1, 2020) isn't just the best laptop Apple has ever made, it's the best laptop money can buy right now. This is the first time a MacBook has topped our best laptops list, but the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is worthy of this spot. Thanks to the revolutionary ARM-based Apple M1 chip that powers the new MacBook Air (Apple has ditched Intel for these new laptops), this is a stunning achievement: a thin and light laptop that offers great performance, even with 4K video editing, while also offering incredible battery life. Easily managing over 11 hours on a single charge, this is a laptop you can easily carry around with you at work or school, and its price is incredibly competitive compared to Windows 10 rivals like the Dell XPS 15 (below). Running both new and old Mac apps, the new MacBook Air can now also run iOS apps for iPhone and iPads, giving it access to hundreds of brilliant mobile applications and games as well.\\n\\nEven if you've only ever used Windows laptops before, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is well worth getting and making the jump to macOS. Yes, it really is that good.\n",

      "text": "Issues with saving edits to ProRAW format images in the Photos app have been solved, too, and iCloud Drive sync flaws as well, plus Apple has resolved a problem whereby System Preferences would fail to unlock when entering the correct admin password.\n\nSpeaking of System Preferences, head here and click on Software Update to grab version 11.2 for yourself. Those with affected MacBook or Mac mini M1 machines will doubtless want to do so quickly if they are suffering at the hands of that Bluetooth bug.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no mention of a solution for the other annoying bug we’ve seen reported by some users in recent times, namely the screensaver randomly popping up on M1-powered Macs. So presumably that’s a fix for another day, even though from what we heard on the grapevine, the 11.2 beta supposedly provided a cure.",
